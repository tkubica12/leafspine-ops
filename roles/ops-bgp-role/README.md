## Overview

OpenSwitch `bgp` provides the foundation to configure the switch with BGP
peering as well as reachabilities.  Using the unique OpenSwitch Declarative
Configuration (DC) APIs, it reduces the interaction with the switch
tremendously.  It also offers the traditional iterative operations to ease
the transition.

### Requirements
