# OpenSwitch switch Role

## Overview

OpenSwitch `switch` provides the foundation to configure the layer 2 and 3
reachabilies, e.g. VLANs, IPv4, and/or IPv6 addresses, on the switch.
Using the unique OpenSwitch Declarative Configuration (DC) APIs, it reduces
the interaction with the switch tremendously.  It also offers the traditional
iterative operations to ease the transition.

### Requirements

- Ansible 2.1 or later
